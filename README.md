# Milestone2
In this project i created a serial server and a parallel server, which supports clients,
by reciving problems such as a matrix, and returning a solution. 
The specific problems in this program are finding a path from initial cell to a goal cell defined by the client (with it's cost).

# The Algorithms
The search algorithms of finding the path are:
AStar
Best First Search
Breadth First Search
Depth First Search

# Results
In testing the algorithm and find out which one returns best results by cost for a path in average, the Astar algorithm had the best results, as we can see in the graph.

# INSTRUCTIONS:
Compile the program.
Run the program with an argument for port number.
